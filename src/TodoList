=======================TESTING RELATED=======================
-add shaper related tests for winconditionDAO
-addWC must throw exception in case of failure

-add error representations to wallPageResource and the win condition resource
-create an error Representation class.

-make the winconditions links in the .ftl file for the wall.
-add username/password hash to cookie for authentication

- need to write Issue DAO for fetching issues per win condition i.e., issues for a single WC only

--May 22nd--
- When adding the 'first' WC erase the info of "no win conditions exist"
- deletion and addition of data needs to be authorized - must have a DAO test in place and a UI provision for the same.
- editing of WIO must also update the timestamp?? - may need a separate 'last updated' edit field in DB

--June 25th--
- Concurrent Edit/delete handling!! ==> storing of timestamp with each entity on the page
- Add user management for different users = cookies + authentication/authorization + basic cryptography
- Enhance queries to take in values of the parent's PK like issue query also takes in WCID as part of query - check if valuable from security standpoint


-- June 26th
- Delete data-winbook-delete/edit data items/tags. Redundant. Use hasClass(...) based comparison instead.
- Refactor "ADD" functionality for entities to return generated Id as well as timestamp
- Add "error:" cases to jquery's ajax functionality to show better error dialogs
- add exceptions to DAOs for missing id's before updating etc., and update test cases
- Also need to put in extra checks before insertion of issues/option/comments to ensure the parent exists and has not been deleted by a concurrent request

- Async update fetching of win conditions and categories.

- Edit Category text

- What if instead of numeric ids someone sends invalid ids in the URL? The current Integer.parseInts may fail! Fix that

-Disable access/modifications for non-members and deletion rights for shapers
-fix the query for getting all projects a person is member of. The group by on project_title will suppress some of the email id's for joining and may not work as expected.
-(above query IS BUGGY) - fix it for non-membership i.e., projects for which user is already member shows up in non-member list too...
-if # of selected posts == 0 then no categorization should be applied - seems something is still sent to the server but nothing really happens....

- handle graceful logout i.e., if user presses back button, makes a change the entire login page comes in jquery popup - do something like the following:
